# BACKEND

🚀 This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Backend Development** using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
Here, I’ll be sharing my notes, code samples, mini-projects, and experiments as I master the backend!

---

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database
- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js
- **React.js** – Frontend library (optional here but part of MERN)
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment

---

## ✨ What you'll find here

✅ Clean code examples for backend concepts  
✅ APIs built with Express + Node  
✅ MongoDB integration examples  
✅ Authentication (JWT, sessions)  
✅ Middleware, error handling, validations  
✅ My personal notes & learning progress

## 🚀 How to run the code

> 📝 Each project or file will have its own `README.md` (coming soon). But here’s a general idea:

1️⃣ Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Mohit8-8/BACKEND.git`

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3️⃣ Start the server:
`node app.js `
or
`nodemon "name".js`
